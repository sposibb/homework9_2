                  This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
                  travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve
                  thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                  slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its
                  cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The
                  buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and
                  then deafening

                  bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having
                  taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change
                  their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam
                  could contain.

                  The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the
                  platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to
                  be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited
                  philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get
                  out of the way. Passepartout was furious at the delay they
                  occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers
                  upon them.

                  "What acountry!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and
                  go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding
                  travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw
                  this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who
                  doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"

                and he was wise.
